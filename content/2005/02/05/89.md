#Stop & Go

For those who are not aware of it I stopped, and since I had quit a lot of inertia it has taken some time which I couldn't spend on writing unreadable bits of texts about the joy of traveling in the direction of "approximately East". 
Stopped in India, to work 6 month at least in the fastest developing sector there: delocalization. I decided to take a peek before my future job end there. 
In the mean time I succeeded to fit a 20 days return flight to Europe, so as to see some persons, and my first week of work among the surpopulated.
