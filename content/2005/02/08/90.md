#The hotel week

It's a funny thing a hostel. As you're not really given the opportunity to clean you quickly realize how fast one can dirty a room with its diverse dejections, and this is including the toilet flushing. 
It also led me to discover the wonderful universe of Indian TV, which in turns led me to decide that I will never buy one as long as the best channel will be FashionTV. And this is with the fact they broadcast less underwear collections than in any other country, I'm sure of that...
