<p>Here is the <a class="external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/2003/30/113820/http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGA53CMMECD.html">latest</a> step in the "Ihaveitbecausethereisanicelogoonit" fashion movement.</p>

<p>Please be carefull about <a class="external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/2003/30/113820/http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war.html">war</a>, it's <a class="external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/2003/30/113820/http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/000290.html#000290">dangerous</a>, or so it's said <a class="external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/2003/30/113820/http://www.ready.gov/">here</a>.</p>

<p>But email scam is not <a class="external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/2003/30/113820/http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284/57/60,00.html">safer</a>, or it is just be the result of 3 years of a massive psychological action from someone who's got a tooth against nigeria, maybe some bad holidays there, who knows...</p>

<p>One of those small <a class="external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/2003/30/113820/http://taat.fi/taat/porrasturvat/">game</a> which you shouldn't try at work, can stop a whole bunch of people from doing anything usefull but to try to break as many bones as possible. Windows/maybe Wine only I'm afraid.</p>
